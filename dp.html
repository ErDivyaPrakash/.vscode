    <h2>“The Waste Land”</h2>
    <p>
        Without a doubt one of the most important poems of the 20th century. “It has never lost its glamour,” Paul <br>
        Muldoon observed. “It has never failed to be equal to both the fracture of its own era and what, alas, turned <br>
        out to be the even greater fracture of the ongoing 20th century and now, it seems, the 21st century.” See <also:br></also:br>
        “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.”<br>

    <p>Love is considered to be both positive and negative, with its virtue representing human kindness, compassion, and
        affection, as "the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another" and its vice representing
        human moral flaw, akin to vanity.</p>
    <h2>Definitions</h2>
    <p>The word "love" can have a variety of related but distinct meanings in different contexts. Many other languages
        use multiple words to express some of the different concepts that in English are denoted as "love"; </p>
    <h2>Impersonal</h2>
    <h3>i am h3</h3>
    <h4>i am h4</h4>
    <h5>i am h5</h5>
    <h6>i am h6</h6>
    <p>People can be said to love an object, principle, or goal to which they are deeply committed and greatly value.
        For example, compassionate outreach and volunteer workers' "love" of their cause may sometimes be born not of
        interpersonal love but impersonal love, altruism, and strong spiritual or political convictions.</p>
