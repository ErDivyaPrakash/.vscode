    <h2>Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code
        readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented
        approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.[31]

        Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming <a
            href="huraa">paradigms</a> paradigms, including
        structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a

            the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[41] capable of
            exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[11] Its implementation began in
            December 1989.[
